Control-Moment-Gyroscope-Inverted-Pendulum

# Abstract
This project deals with comparison of Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) for Control Moment Gyroscope (CMG) inverted pendulum. The CMG dynamics are highly nonlinear, and we observe through numerical simulation that EKF performs well compare to UKF for this system. However, we note that the performance of both the state-estimation algorithm depends on various tuning parameters. If these tuning parameters are not selected carefully then we may experience performance degradation. The results are documented in [1].
